        />Steptoe Butte is a quartzite island jutting out of the silty loess of
        the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palouse">Palouse</a> hills in
        Whitman County, Washington. The rock that forms the butte is over 400
        million years old, in contrast with the 15-7 million year old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River">Columbia River</a>
        basalts that underlie the rest of the Palouse (such "islands" of ancient
        rock have come to be called buttes, a butte being defined as a small
        hill with a flat top, whose width at top does not exceed its height).

        A hotel built by Cashup Davis stood atop Steptoe Butte from 1888 to
        1908, burning down several years after it closed. In 1946, Virgil
        McCroskey donated 120 acres (0.49 km2) of land to form Steptoe Butte
        State Park, which was later increased to over 150 acres (0.61 km2).
        Steptoe Butte is currently recognized as a National Natural Landmark
        because of its unique geological value. It is named in honor of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Edward_Steptoe">
          Colonel Edward Steptoe</a
        >.
