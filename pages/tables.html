      <h1>Breaking News!</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Breaking news, also known as a special report or news
    bulletin, is a current issue that broadcasters feel warrants
    the interruption of scheduled programming and/or current news
    in order to report its details. Its use is also assigned to
    the most significant story of the moment or a story that is
    being covered live. It could be a story that is simply of wide
    interest to viewers and has little impact otherwise. Many
    times, breaking news is used after the news network has
    already reported on this story. When a story has not been
    reported on previously, the graphic and phrase "Just In" is
    sometimes used instead.</p>
    <p>In early coverage of a breaking story, details are commonly
    sketchy, usually due to the limited information available at the
    time. For example, during the Sago Mine disaster, initial reports
    were that all twelve miners were found alive, but news
    organizations later found only one actually survived.</p>
    <p>Another criticism has been the diluting of the importance of
    breaking news by the need of 24-hour news channels to fill time,
    applying the title to soft news stories of questionable importance
    and urgency, for example car chases. Others question whether the
    use of the term is excessive, citing occasions when the term is
    used even though scheduled programming is not interrupted.</p>
